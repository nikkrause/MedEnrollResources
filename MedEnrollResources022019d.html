					<p>Use the resources in this educational tool to learn how to enroll in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Program, revalidate your enrollment, or change your enrollment information. You must enroll in the Medicare Program to get payment for covered services you provide to Medicare beneficiaries. You must enroll if you solely order items or certify services, and you will not submit claims for these services.</p>
					
					<p>You can enroll online by using the <a href="https://pecos.cms.hhs.gov/pecos/login.do" target="_blank">Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS)</a> or the appropriate paper enrollment application submitted to a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). CMS wants providers to use PECOS instead of the paper Medicare enrollment application. First get an <a href="#" target="_blank">Identity &amp; Access Management (I&amp;A) System</a> user account. Second, apply in the <a href="https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov" target="_blank">National Plan and Provider Enumeration System</a> for your National Provider Identifier (NPI). Finally, enroll in PECOS.</p>
